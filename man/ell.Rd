\arguments{
\item{fixed}{a two-sided linear formula object describing the
linear regression model with the dependent variable on the left of a ~ operator
and the explanatory variables on the right, separated by + operators. The argument corresponds
to the argument \code{fixed} in function \code{\link[nlme]{lme}}.}

\item{alpha}{a one-sides linear formula describing the independent variables used to predict
variance in the "alpha" model}

\item{pop_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise the variables
named on the right of the ~ operator in \code{fixed}, i.e. the explanatory
variables, and \code{pop_domains}.}

\item{pop_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates domains in the population data. The variable can be numeric or
a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{smp_domains}.}

\item{pop_subdomains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates sub-domains in the population data. When this option is specified, a
two-fold nested error model is used. Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{smp_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise all variables named in
\code{fixed} and \code{smp_domains}.}

\item{smp_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable
that indicates domains in the sample data. The variable can be numeric or a
factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{pop_domains}.
#' @param smp_subdomains a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates sub-domains in the sample data. When this option is specified, a
two-fold nested error model is used. Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{L}{a number determining the number of Monte-Carlo simulations that
must be at least 1. Defaults to 50. For practical applications, values
larger than 200 are recommended (see also
\cite{Molina, I. and Rao, J.N.K. (2010)}).}

\item{threshold}{a number defining a threshold. Alternatively, a threshold
may be defined as a \code{function} of \code{y} returning a numeric value.
Such a function will be evaluated once for the point estimation and in each
iteration of the parametric bootstrap. A threshold is needed for calculation
e.g. of head count ratios and poverty gaps. The  argument defaults to
\code{NULL}. In this case, the threshold is set to 60\% of the median of the
variable that is selected as dependent variable similary to the
at-risk-of-poverty rate used in the EU (see also
\cite{Social Protection  Committee 2001}). However, any desired threshold can
be chosen.}

\item{transformation}{a character string. Five different transformation
types for the dependent variable can be chosen (i) no transformation ("no");
(ii) log transformation ("log"); (iii) Box-Cox transformation ("box.cox");
(iv) Dual transformation ("dual"); (v) Log-Shift transformation
("log.shift"); (Vi) rank-order transformation ("ordernorm"). Defaults to
\code{"box.cox"}.}

\item{interval}{a string equal to 'default' or a numeric vector containing a
lower and upper limit determining an interval for the estimation of the
optimal parameter. The interval is passed to function
\code{\link[stats]{optimize}} for the optimization. Defaults to 'default'
which equals c(-1,2) for Box-Cox, c(0,2) for Dual and an interval based on
the range of y for Log-Shift transformation. If the convergence fails, it is
often advisable to choose a smaller more suitable interval. For right skewed
distributions, the negative values may be excluded, also values larger than
1 are seldom observed.}

\item{seed}{an integer to set the seed for the random number generator. For
the usage of random number generation, see Details. If seed is set to
\code{NULL}, seed is chosen randomly. Defaults to \code{123}.}

\item{custom_indicator}{a list of functions containing the indicators to be
calculated additionally. Such functions must depend on the target variable
\code{y}, and optional can depend on \code{pop_weights} and the
\code{threshold}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{na.rm}{if \code{TRUE}, observations with \code{NA} values are deleted
from the population and sample data. For the EBP procedure complete
observations are required. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates weights in the sample data. If a character string is provided
a weighted version of the ebp will be used. The variable has to be numeric.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{pop_weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates population weights in the population data. If a character string
is provided weighted indicators are estimated using population weights.
The variable has to be numeric. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{aggregate_to}{a character string containing the name of a variable from
population data that indicates the target domain level for which the
results are to be displayed. The variable can be numeric or a factor.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{benchmark}{The input depends on the type of benchmarking to be
performed.
(i) Benchmarking with a fixed value:
(a) with one value for each indicator: a named vector containing the numeric
benchmark value(s). The names of the vector matchs to the chosen indicators.
Benchmarking is available for \code{"Mean"} and \code{"Head_Count"}.
(b) with values for the sub-level specified in the argument
\code{benchmark_level}: a data.frame composed of a variable of class
character containing the domain names at which the benchmarkaing is
performed and variable(s) with benchmark value(s) of class numeric.
Benchmarking is supplied for the Mean and the Head_Count ratio. Therefore,
the names of the data.frame must match for the first variable the
benchmark_level and for the other(s) to Mean and Head_Count.
(ii) Benchmarking with the survey data: a vector containing the names of the
chosen indicators. In this case, survey weights (\code{weights}) are needed.
Benchmarking is available for \code{"Mean"} and \code{"Head_Count"}.}

\item{benchmark_type}{a character indicating the type of benchmarking. Types
that can be chosen (i) Raking ("\code{raking}"), (ii) Ratio adjustment
("\code{ratio}"), and for head count, ratio adjustment of the complement
("\code{ratio_complement}". Defaults to "\code{ratio}"}

\item{benchmark_level}{a character indicating the level at which the
benchmarking is performed. This name must be represented in the sample and
population data as variable name.}

\item{benchmark_weights}{the name of variable containing benchmark weights.
This is only possible for internal benchmarking and enable users to benchmark
with weights differing from the survey weights (Default for weighting for
internal benchmarking).}

\item{rescale_weights}{a logical indicating if the sample weights are scaled.
If \code{FALSE} (default), the sample weights do not change. When \code{TRUE}
, the sample weights are rescaled such that the average weight is 1
within each domain.}

\item{random_method}{selects the method used by the plm function to estimate the random effects model.
It can take on the values "swar" (default), "amemiya", "walhus", or "nerlove"}

\item{Ydump}{a string specifying the name of a .csv file to save all simulated
values of the dependent value, model predictions, and error terms used for
point estimation.}

\item{errors}{a string containing either "normal" or "nonnormal". If normal, error terms
are drawn from a normal distribution. If non-normal, error terms are drawn via a
non-parametric bootstrap.}

\item{model_parameters}{a string specifying "fixed" or "variable". If variable is specified,
estimates of model parameters beta and sigma will be drawn from their estimated
distribution. Otherwise they are assumed fixed. Defaults to "variable".}

\item{indicators}{a list of strings containing outcome indicators that should be calculated.
Defaults to NULL, which selects all indicators.}

\item{weights_type}{a character string. Two different methods for survey
weights are available (i) EBP under informative sampling from
\cite{Guadarrama et al. (2018)} ("Guadarrama"); (ii) considering survey
weights by using the weighting options of \code{\link{nlme}} from
\cite{Pinheiro and Bates (2023)} ("nlme"); (iii) considering survey
weights by using the weighting options of \code{\link{nlme}} and use these
weights also to determine the optimal transformation parameter lambda
("nlme_lambda"). Defaults to \code{"Guadarrama"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "ell", "emdi" that provides estimators for
regional disaggregated indicators.
Several generic functions have methods for the returned object. For a full
list and descriptions of the components of objects of class "emdi",
see \code{\link{emdiObject}}.
}
\description{
Function \code{ebp} estimates indicators using the
approach by \cite{Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2010)}. Point predictions of indicators
are obtained by Monte-Carlo approximations based on an unconditional random effect
model. Additionally, variance is estimated treating parameters as uncertain.
As in EBP, five different transformation types for the dependent variable can be chosen.
This approach can be extended to data under informative sampling using
weights and is based on \cite{Guadarrama et al. (2018)}.
}
\details{
For Monte-Carlo approximationsrandom number generation is used.
Thus, a seed is set by the
argument \code{seed}. \cr \cr
The set of predefined indicators includes the mean, median, four further
quantiles (10\%, 25\%, 75\% and 90\%), head count ratio, poverty gap, Gini
coefficient and the quintile share ratio. \cr \cr
Since the sample observations often cannot be identified in practical
applications, a modified approach by Guadarrama et al. (2016) called census
EBP is implemented for the point estimation. For the MSE estimation, the
bootstrap sample is not extracted from the superpopulation, but generated by
the estimated model parameters. The lower the ratio between the sample and
the population size, the closer are the results to the proposed approach by
}
