\arguments{
\item{fixed}{a two-sided linear formula object describing the
fixed-effects part of the nested error linear regression model with the
dependent variable on the left of a ~ operator and the explanatory
variables on the right, separated by + operators. The argument corresponds
to the argument \code{fixed} in function \code{\link[nlme]{lme}}.}

\item{pop_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise the variables
named on the right of the ~ operator in \code{fixed}, i.e. the explanatory
variables, and \code{pop_domains}.}

\item{pop_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates domains in the population data. The variable can be numeric or
a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{smp_domains}.}

\item{smp_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise all variables named in
\code{fixed} and \code{smp_domains}.}

\item{smp_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable
that indicates domains in the sample data. The variable can be numeric or a
factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{pop_domains}.}

\item{L}{a number determining the number of Monte-Carlo simulations that
must be at least 1. Defaults to 50. For practical applications, values
larger than 200 are recommended (see also
\cite{Molina, I. and Rao, J.N.K. (2010)}).}

\item{threshold}{a number defining a threshold. Alternatively, a threshold
may be defined as a \code{function} of \code{y} returning a numeric value.
Such a function will be evaluated once for the point estimation and in each
iteration of the parametric bootstrap. A threshold is needed for calculation
e.g. of head count ratios and poverty gaps. The  argument defaults to
\code{NULL}. In this case, the threshold is set to 60\% of the median of the
variable that is selected as dependent variable similary to the
at-risk-of-poverty rate used in the EU (see also
\cite{Social Protection  Committee 2001}). However, any desired threshold can
be chosen.}

\item{transformation}{a character string. Five different transformation
types for the dependent variable can be chosen (i) no transformation ("no");
(ii) log transformation ("log"); (iii) Box-Cox transformation ("box.cox");
(iv) Dual transformation ("dual"); (v) Log-Shift transformation
("log.shift"); (Vi) rank-order transformation ("ordernorm"). Defaults to
\code{"box.cox"}.}

\item{interval}{a string equal to 'default' or a numeric vector containing a
lower and upper limit determining an interval for the estimation of the
optimal parameter. The interval is passed to function
\code{\link[stats]{optimize}} for the optimization. Defaults to 'default'
which equals c(-1,2) for Box-Cox, c(0,2) for Dual and an interval based on
the range of y for Log-Shift transformation. If the convergence fails, it is
often advisable to choose a smaller more suitable interval. For right skewed
distributions, the negative values may be excluded, also values larger than
1 are seldom observed.}

\item{MSE}{if \code{TRUE}, MSE estimates using a parametric bootstrap
approach are calculated (see also \cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)}).
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{B}{a number determining the number of bootstrap populations in the
parametric bootstrap approach (see also
\cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)}) used in the MSE estimation. The
number must be greater than 1. Defaults to 50. For practical applications,
values larger than 200 are recommended (see also
\cite{Molina, I. and Rao, J.N.K. (2010)}).}

\item{na.rm}{if \code{TRUE}, observations with \code{NA} values are deleted
from the population and sample data. For the EBP procedure complete
observations are required. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates weights in the sample data. If a character string is provided
a weighted version of the ebp will be used. The variable has to be numeric.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{pop_weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates population weights in the populatation data. If a character string
is provided weighted indicators are estimated using population weights.
The variable has to be numeric. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{aggregate_to}{a character string containing the name of a variable from
population data that indicates the target domain level for which the
results are to be displayed. The variable can be numeric or a factor.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{custom_indicator}{a list of functions containing the indicators to be
calculated additionally. Such functions must depend on the target variable
\code{y}, and optional can depend on \code{pop_weights} and the
\code{threshold}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{benchmark}{The input depends on the type of benchmarking to be
performed.
(i) Benchmarking with a fixed value:
(a) with one value for each indicator: a named vector containing the numeric
benchmark value(s). The names of the vector matchs to the chosen indicators.
Benchmarking is available for \code{"Mean"} and \code{"Head_Count"}.
(b) with values for the sub-level specified in the argument
\code{benchmark_level}: a data.frame composed of a variable of class
character containing the domain names at which the benchmarkaing is
performed and variable(s) with benchmark value(s) of class numeric.
Benchmarking is supplied for the Mean and the Head_Count ratio. Therefore,
the names of the data.frame must match for the first variable the
benchmark_level and for the other(s) to Mean and Head_Count.
(ii) Benchmarking with the survey data: a vector containing the names of the
chosen indicators. In this case, survey weights (\code{weights}) are needed.
Benchmarking is available for \code{"Mean"} and \code{"Head_Count"}.}

\item{benchmark_type}{a character indicating the type of benchmarking. Types
that can be chosen (i) Raking ("\code{raking}"), (ii) Ratio adjustment
("\code{ratio}"), and for head count, ratio adjustment of the complement
("\code{ratio_complement}". Defaults to "\code{ratio}"}

\item{benchmark_weights}{the name of variable containing benchmark weights.
This is only possible for internal benchmarking and enable users to benchmark
with weights differing from the survey weights (Default for weighting for
internal benchmarking).}

\item{Q}{the quantiles for fitting the M-quantile regression.}

\item{method}{the method is used to obtain area-specific tuning parameter.
Two methods can be chosen (i) "LBP": linear best predictor (ii) "Naive": traditional method.}

\item{tol}{the accuracy for the stopping criterion.}

\item{maxit}{the limit on the number of algorithm iterations.}

\item{k_b}{tuning constant used for Huber influence function for the estimation of the coefficients.}

\item{k_sigma_u}{tuning constant used for Huber influence function for the estimation of the sigma2u.}

\item{k_sigma_e}{tuning constant used for Huber influence function for
the estimation of the area-specific coefficients.}

\value{
An object of class "hdp", "emdi" that provides estimators for
regional disaggregated indicators and optionally corresponding MSE estimates.
Several generic functions have methods for the returned object. For a full
list and descriptions of the components of objects of class "emdi",
see \code{\link{emdiObject}}.
}
\description{
Function \code{hdp} estimates indicators using the Empirical Best
Prediction approach by \cite{Lahiri and Salvati (2023)} under
a flexible nested error regression small area model with high dimensional
parameter that incorporates heterogeneity in regression coefficients
and variance components. They proposed a new robust small area specific
estimating equations method that allows appropriate pooling of a large
number of areas in estimating small area specific model parameters. After
obtaining the estimated area-specific model parameters, point predictions
of indicators are obtained by Monte-Carlo approximations
proposed by \cite{Molina and Rao (2020)}. A parametric bootstrap method
is used to estimate the mean squared errors.
