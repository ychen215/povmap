Description: The R package 'povmap' supports small area estimation of means and 
  poverty headcount rates. It adds several new features to the 'emdi' package
  (see "The R Package emdi for Estimating and Mapping Regionally Disaggregated 
  Indicators" by Kreutzmann et al. (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i07>). 
  These include new options for incorporating survey weights, ex-post 
  benchmarking of estimates, two additional transformations, several new 
  convenient functions to assist with reporting results, and a wrapper function 
  to facilitate access from 'Stata'.
