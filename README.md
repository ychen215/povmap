# povmap: Extension to the package emdi

The R package povmap is designed to facilitate the production 
of small area estimates of means and poverty headcount rates. It adds several 
new features to the emdi package. These include new options for 
incorporating survey weights, ex-post benchmarking of estimates, two additional 
transformations, and several new convenient functions to assist with reporting 
results.
